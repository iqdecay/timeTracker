# A time tracker

The project is to develop a time tracker so I can track time 
spent on a development project.

I will use [andlabs/ui](https://github.com/andlabs/ui) to have
a nice GUI that is compatible with all platforms, and not terminal
based.


## Usage :

- First, install dependencies :

  `go get github.com/andlabs/ui`
- Run the program : 
 
  `go run tracker.go`
  
  
 Or you can just use the provided binary by running :
 
 `./tracker`

- [ ] Add confirmation for deletion
